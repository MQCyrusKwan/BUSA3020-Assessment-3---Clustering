*** : The Hubert index is a graphical method of determining the number of clusters.
                In the plot of Hubert index, we seek a significant knee that corresponds to a
                significant increase of the value of the measure i.e the significant peak in Hubert
                index second differences plot.

*** : The D index is a graphical method of determining the number of clusters. 
                In the plot of D index, we seek a significant knee (the significant peak in Dindex
                second differences plot) that corresponds to a significant increase of the value of
                the measure.

* 3 proposed 3 as the best number of clusters 
* 4 proposed 4 as the best number of clusters
* 2 proposed 5 as the best number of clusters
* 1 proposed 7 as the best number of clusters
* 2 proposed 9 as the best number of clusters
* 1 proposed 13 as the best number of clusters
* 2 proposed 14 as the best number of clusters
